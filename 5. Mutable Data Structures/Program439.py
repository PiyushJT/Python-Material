Write a Program to Print Longest Common Prefix from a
given list of strings. The longest common prefix for list of strings
is the common prefix (starting of string) between
all strings. For example, in the given list [“apple”, “ape”, “zebra”], there
is no common prefix because the 2 most dissimilar
strings of the list “ape” and “zebra” do not share any starting
characters. If there is no common prefix between
all strings in the list than return -1.
